## üåê Free Hosting & Deployment
You can host this app for free using:
- **Frontend:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Render](https://render.com), [Railway](https://railway.app)
- **Backend:** [Render](https://render.com), [Railway](https://railway.app)

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Deploy the frontend (Vite) to Vercel/Netlify/Render.
3. Deploy the backend (Express) to Render/Railway.
4. Set the frontend's `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your backend's deployed URL.
5. Set the backend's CORS and allowed origins as needed.

## üìÑ Environment Setup

- You must create a `.env` file in the project root with the following four variables:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001                # URL of your backend API
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173                # URL of your frontend (for CORS)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-google-cloud-project-id      # Google Cloud project ID for Vertex AI
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=google-service-account.json # Path to your Google service account JSON file
```

- These are required for the frontend to communicate with the backend, for proper CORS configuration, and for enabling Google Vertex AI features in the backend.
- Update the values as needed for your deployment.
